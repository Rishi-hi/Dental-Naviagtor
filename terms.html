    <div class="container">
        <h2>Welcome to Dental  Navigator</h2>
        <p>By accessing or using our platform, you agree to the following terms and conditions. These terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use our service.</p>

        <h3>Eligibility for Bonus</h3>
        <p>Bonuses are offered at our discretion and are subject to verification and eligibility. Patients must book an appointment through our referral link and complete the visit to qualify. Bonuses are only granted for verified appointments that occur with participating dental partners.</p>

        <h3>Referral Program</h3>
        <p>Referrers must be existing users of Dental Navigator. Referred patients must be new and complete their first visit to be eligible. Bonuses are processed within 5–7 business days of verification. Each user may refer multiple individuals; however, duplicate or fraudulent referrals will result in account termination.</p>

        <h3>Appointment Fees and Payouts</h3>
        <p>Dental  Navigator charges a fee to the dentist for each patient appointment on the same day of service. This ensures commitment and coordination from both ends. Similarly, patients who attend their verified appointment receive their reward on the same day through approved payment methods.</p>

        <h3>Verification Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Book through Dental Navigator's official links.</li>
            <li>Attend the full dental appointment.</li>
            <li>Provide accurate and verifiable identity information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Misuse of Platform</h3>
        <p>Accounts found to be engaging in fraudulent activity such as booking fake appointments, using false identities, or exploiting referral systems will be permanently banned and ineligible for rewards. Legal action may be taken where applicable.</p>

        <h3>Payment Disputes</h3>
        <p>All payments are processed based on internal tracking and dentist confirmation. In the event of a dispute, our team will investigate thoroughly and reserves the final decision on bonus issuance.</p>

        <h3>Coverage & Insurance</h3>
        <p>Dentist Navigator works with a wide range of dental insurance plans and public coverage options including:</p>
